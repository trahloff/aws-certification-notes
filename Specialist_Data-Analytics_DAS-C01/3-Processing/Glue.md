## Misc

- Glue crawlers can crawl data in different AWS region or another account

- Glue Data Catalogs have Resource Policies

- The following are other reasons why you might want to **manually** create catalog tables and specify catalog tables as the crawler source:

  - You want to choose the catalog table name and not rely on the catalog table naming algorithm.
  - You want to prevent new tables from being created in the case where files with a format that could disrupt partition detection are mistakenly saved in the data source path.

- Glue can load from SQL but DB needs to be in own VPC

- ETL Code Options: Python + Scala

- You can run existing ETL jobs w/ Glue

- You can build custom classifiers for Glue Crawlers

- You can use Spark extension functions
