## Misc

- **S3DistCP** - Copy large amounts of data S3 <=> HDFS (x-acc, x-buckets)
- **Sqoop** - Same stuff as S3DistCP but for relational DBs
- Notebooks can only be opened after AWS login
- Deleting the EMR Cluster will delete the EBS volumes. Copy data to S3 to preserve it
- Pig doesn't support JDBC access
